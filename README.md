#[Linkur](http://linkur.co.in) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Linkur/linkur.png?branch=v2)](https://travis-ci.org/Linkur/linkur)
a simple, speedy way to share URL's within groups

##The Problem
We've always found it a problem to share links within our group. Moreso re-look them up. We've used email as a solution for this and even services like hipchat but nothing is really satisfactory, so we thought "Hey, why not build one ourselves?" 

So here we are. 

##The Solution
Linkur is a place where anyone in your "group" can post a link and its visible to the others. 

##Pre-prequisites
* python 2.7
    * Flask
