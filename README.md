#[Linkur](http://linkur.co.in)
a simple, speedy way to share URL's within groups

Try it out @ [http://linkur.co.in](http://linkur.co.in)

##The Problem
We've always found it a problem to share links within our group. Moreso re-look them up. We've used email as a solution for this and even services like hipchat but nothing is really satisfactory, so we thought "Hey, why not build one ourselves?" 

So here we are. 

##The Solution
Linkur is a place where anyone in your "group" can post a link and its visible to the others.
